I think the one big thing I want to note here is that we do NOT want to pin versions in tox.ini. While I know this can help stabilize builds, the issue is that just from py3.8 to py3.10, the versions ansible, molecule, ansible-lint, etc are wildly different.\n\nAt least until we drop 3.8 (hopefully in the next 9 months), I think we should just let pip install the latest versions of the requirements for each version of python.",
